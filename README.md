🥚 Egg Catcher Game — Python (Pygame)

A fast-paced mini-game built using Python & Pygame, where you control a basket to catch falling eggs.
The game tests your reflexes as eggs drop faster with time, and your score keeps increasing with every successful catch. Simple controls, smooth animation, and a clean UI make it fun and easy to play.

⭐ Key Highlights

Keyboard-controlled basket movement

Randomly falling eggs

Increasing speed for difficulty

Score counter + life system

Lightweight & beginner-friendly code

▶️ Run the Game
pip install pygame
python main.py

📌 How It Works

Eggs fall from random positions, you move the basket left/right to catch them. Each catch gives points, and missed eggs reduce lives. Lose all lives → Game Over.
